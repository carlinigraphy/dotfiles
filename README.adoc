= dotfiles
Better centralized dotfile management.


== What is it?
Both...

. A growing collection of my dotfiles, as I find the time/will to import them, and
. A shell script to help achieve the prior


== How it work?
Running `dot` moves a file/dir here, then symlinks it back.

I got tired of trying to maintain a version of my _.bashrc_ for macOS, another for my Debian server, another for my Arch laptop...
This makes it easier.

.E.g.,
----
dotfiles/
 `-- bash
      +-- arch.bashrc
      `-- macos.bashrc
----


== TODO
This approach still doesn't feel completely '`right`'.
There's far more similarity between different versions of a _.bashrc_ or _i3/config_ than different.

There is merit to the older version(s) of this project that assumed a *base* file of common elements, and *additions* files to account for differences.
Worth revisiting at a later date.
